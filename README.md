LA City Council election (Nithya Raman and David Ryu)

Academically interesting

August 7th declared, 15 month campaign

female, newcomer defeats incumbent, timing of election (a la presidential election), COVID factor

national awareness, huge endorsements on both sides (bernie, hillary, pelosi, feinstein, celebs)

no PAC, corporate money defeats $800,000 PAC, corporate funded incumbent

within a few points in primary, goes to runoff, but covid means need to change strategy!

timeline of mentions, twitter activity by candidates, location data, sentiment analysis
